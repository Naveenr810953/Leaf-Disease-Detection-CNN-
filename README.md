# 🌾 Context-Aware Disease Diagnosis: A Multimodal CNN-LSTM for Farms

A groundbreaking **multimodal deep learning system** that combines computer vision with environmental context to deliver highly accurate agricultural disease diagnosis. This innovative approach solves the critical "ambiguity problem" in plant pathology by integrating visual symptoms with weather patterns.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a highly accurate **"in-the-wild" disease classifier** that solves the fundamental **"ambiguity problem"** in agricultural diagnostics. For example, a yellow spot on a leaf could be:

- **Fungal Infection** (like Rust, which thrives in high humidity)  
- **Nutrient Deficiency** (unrelated to weather conditions)

By feeding the model both the **image** and **recent weather data**, it learns to make intelligent, context-aware diagnoses that traditional single-modal systems cannot achieve.

## 🧠 The "Untouched" Hybrid Architecture

This is not just another CNN or LSTM project. It's a **unified multimodal network** with two specialized branches:

### 🖼️ CNN Branch (Visual Analysis)
- **Input**: Real-field crop photographs
- **Model**: Pre-trained CNN (MobileNetV2/ResNet)
- **Output**: Feature vector describing visual patterns (spots, colors, textures)

### 🌤️ LSTM Branch (Contextual Analysis)  
- **Input**: 7-14 days of historical weather data
- **Model**: LSTM/RNN network
- **Output**: Context vector summarizing environmental trends

### 🔄 Fusion & Classification
- **Fusion**: Concatenate visual + context vectors
- **Decision**: Final classification using dense layers
- **Output**: Context-aware diagnosis (Rice Blast, Sheath Blight, Nutrient Deficiency, Healthy)

---
### Technical Flow:
1. **Image Processing**: CNN extracts visual features → 1×1024 vector
2. **Weather Processing**: LSTM analyzes temporal patterns → 1×128 vector  
3. **Multimodal Fusion**: Concatenate vectors → 1×1152 combined representation
4. **Context-Aware Classification**: Final diagnosis based on complete situational understanding

## 📁 Data Sources & Collection

### 🌿 Image Data
- **Public Datasets**: Kaggle, GitHub repositories (Rice, Wheat diseases)
- **Field Collection**: 100-200 "in-the-wild" photos from local farms/markets
- **Annotation**: Manual labeling with expert validation

### 🌦️ Environmental Data  
- **Primary Source**: ICAR-CRIDA Crop-Pest-Disease-Weather Database
- **Field Integration**: GPS location + timestamp for each field photo
- **API Supplement**: OpenWeatherMap historical data (14-day weather reconstruction)

### 🎯 The Real Innovation: Data Pairing
The most challenging and novel aspect is creating a **curated multimodal dataset** where each field image is perfectly paired with its corresponding 14-day weather sequence for that specific location and date.
